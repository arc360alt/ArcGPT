# ArcBot, An easy-to-use AI bot made in penguin mod using all of the modern and new AI models 
## If you are having problems like "ArcGPT: Network was not OK: 500" try flipping around models until you get a proper response, some models don't work all the time. (more troubleshooting methods are in the app)
